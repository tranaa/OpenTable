about 5.5 hours, not including the time to refresh on material. If I had more time I would've liked to spent more time on making my components reusable.

First I would try replicating it and make sure it's consistent. View the dev tool to see errors in code or network. Going from there I would examine that related code and drill down from whatever entry point I found.

Enable the endpoint to use additional options for filtering. Something like geolocation would be nice to use but there isn't an endpoint to search within distance of a location/geolocation.
